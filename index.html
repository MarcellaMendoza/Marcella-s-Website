	<h2>Hi there!</h2>
	<p>
		My name's Marcella. I'm a Texas-based full stack web developer with a background in finance who believes that user-centric development, collaboration, and strong communication help make better software.
	</p>
		
	<p>
		I work primarily in CSS, Javascript, React, and MongoDB to build awesome user interfaces and online experiences. I approach software development with a strong user focus that puts accessibility, usability, and sustainability at the front end as well as the back end.
	</p>
	<p>
		When I'm not coding, you can find me playing Roblox with my son, taking care of my houseplants, reading books, eating fruit, crocheting, jumping rope, and scrolling through Twitter!
	</p>
